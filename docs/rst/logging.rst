Logging
=======

Static logger classes make for easy and concise coding. *Logger* facilitates two logger types:

* :ref:`bhenk\logger\log\Log` - for normal use;
* :ref:`bhenk\logger\log\Req` - for logging request properties

Both have static methods as specified on interface `LoggerInterface <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/>`_.
