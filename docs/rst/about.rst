About
=====

Logger facilitates normal logging for applications with wrappers around Monolog\\Logger(s).

Log statements can give insight in what your code is doing but it is awkward to read or follow complete
log files. *Logger* enables you to redirect log output to console during
PHPUnit testing of your application. To not drown in log statements this can be turned on or off on
TestClass and testMethod basis.

Logger is written in PHP.
